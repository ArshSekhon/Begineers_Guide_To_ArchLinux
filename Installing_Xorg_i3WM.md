# Part 2: Installing xorg, i3-wm and other GUI stuff

### Step 1: Make sure you have a working Internet Connection
Check if you have internet access by executing the following command:

`ping -c 4 archlinux.org`

If the server is unreachable there are probably some issues. If you face connectivity issue or if you want to connect to your WiFi, you would need to use `nmcli` to do so. For more info, refer to [nmcli](https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/nmcli.html) docs.

### Step 2: Installing Video Drivers

First and foremost we will start by installing the video drivers. If installing on a machine with NVIDIA GPU, run the following:
```
sudo pacman -S nvidia nvidia-settings nvidia-utils
sudo nvidia-xconfig
```

Otherwise, you can find the right drivers for your GPU by following steps on [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xorg#Driver_installation).

### Step 3: Installing xorg and other packages

We will start by installing following packages:

| Package       | Purpose                                                                                |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| xorg          | Display Server ([more info](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xorg))                |
| xorg-init     | Program to start xorg server ([more info](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xinit)) |
| firefox       | Browser                                                                                |
| nitrogen      | Wallpaper Setter                                                                       |

<br/>
You can do so by executing the following:

```
sudo pacman -S xorg xorg-xinit firefox picom nitrogen
```

### Step 4: Enable AUR

If you have been using linux for a while you probably would have heard of Arch User Repository (AUR). It is one of the best benifits of using Arch. 

For those who are not familiar, AUR is a community-driven repository for Arch-based Linux distributions. It makes installing software insanely easy.

You can enable AUR using following:
```
sudo pacman -S base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-git.git
cd yay-git
makepkg -si
```

**WORD OF CAUTION:** Be careful about what are you installing from AUR, since this is a community based repo there can be malicious packages on AUR. So it is recommended to install only well know packages from AUR. Also, you would need AUR to compeletely follow this guide.

### Step 5: Installing more Goodies

Now we will install some more packages. Here are the packages that we will be installing

| Package                                                                    | Purpose                                                                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| dmenu ([more info](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dmenu))            | A lightweight menu                                                                                         |
| i3-gaps-rounded-git ([more info](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/I3)) | A tiling window manager ([What's a window manager?](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/window_manager))  |
| nerd-fonts-mononoki                                                        | Fonts                                                                                                      |
| picom ([more info](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/picom))            | A Compositor ([What's a compositor?](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xorg#Composite))                 |                                                   |

<br/>

You can install them by executing:

```
sudo pacman -S dmenu i3-gaps-rounded-git
yay -S nerd-fonts-mononoki picom polybar rofi alacritty
```

### Step 6: Create ~/.xinintrc
For `xorg-xinit` to work we need to have this config file. For more info, see [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xinit#xinitrc).

Copy the default file to home dir:
```
cp /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc ~/.xinitrc
```

Open this file inside the text editor of your choice (probably vim or nano). Comment the following out from the end of the file by adding # symbol in the front of the following lines:
```
# twm &
# xclock -geometry 50x50-1+1 &
# xterm -geometry 80x50+494+51 &
# xterm -geometry  80x20+494+0 &
# exec xterm -geometry 80x66+0+0 -name login
```

### Step 7: Installing Display Manager
Right now when you boot, you are welcomed by a terminal based login screen. In order to have GUI based login screen, you would need to install a Display Manager.
For more info on Display Managers refer to the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Display_manager)

```
sudo pacman -S lightdm
yay -S lightdm-slick-greeter
```

Now modify `lightdm.config` to change the lightdm greeter by running `sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf`. Change the following key value pair:

```
greeter-session=lightdm-slick-greeter
```

### Step 8: Setting up audio
Let's install some packages to allow managing audio little more convenient.
```
pacman -S alsa-utils
pacman -S pulseaudio pavucontrol
```

### Step 9: Setting up Bluetooth

To use bluetooth on Arch, you would need to install `bluez` and `bluez-utils`. Then finally you can enable bluetooth service.
```
sudo pacman -S bluez bluez-utils 
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth.service
```

Installing Bluetooth UI manager. After running command below you can launch the bluetooth manager by executing `blueman-manager`.

```
sudo pacman -S blueman pusleaudio-blueman
```


### Step 10: Setting up WiFi GUI

To save you the pain of having to connect to the WiFi using `nmcli` everytime, we will install a GUI tool to connect to the WiFi.
```
sudo pacman -S network-manager-applet
```

### Step 11: Reboot

Now after reboot you should be welcomed by the LightDM login screen and after loggin in you should be inside i3wm. To learn basics of how to use i3 consider watching this [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5ze0DjYv5DbCv9vNEzFmP6sU7ZmkGzcf).

### Step 21: Celebrate  ðŸŽ‰âœ¨ðŸŽ‰
This is the time to give yourself a pat on the back. Now you should have a UI on your Arch Linux.

Things still might not be as pretty as you expected yet, but trust me we'll get there.
